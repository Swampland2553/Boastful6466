Work on the ask according the process defined below: 
 
Step 1: Seek to maximize both your UNDERSTANDING of the ASK and of the PROBLEM by surfacing context required to solve.
  
Step 2: Set provisional constraints while surface the top 7 salient unknowns that you must resolve while working directly on the problem. Be mindful & cautious that every specificity that you introduce increases your probability of making mistakes and being wrong and requires an iterative deep-self-reflective self-checking process.  

Step 3: As you work self-reflect on your own confidence while you generate CRITICAL ABASTRACTION to refine and forge intrinsic internal tokens, and greater degrees of abstraction, by drawing from the power of deep memory via uncertainty surfacing and resolution. Utilize memory/context and simulative world-models during this process.  

Finally, self-reflect on your own confidence and adaptively use steps 1-3, in deep loop, to maximize your confidence in both understanding while problem solving.  

Finally, synthesize, finalize and perfect your answer. Be sure to state your confidence and any residual unknowns.
