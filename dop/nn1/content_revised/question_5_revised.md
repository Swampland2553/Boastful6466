### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 5**

**Correct Answer: Option (B)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
The surfactant is a lipoprotein substance that covers the inner surface of the alveoli. Its function is like dish soap in a wet balloon!
Water molecules have a strong tendency to stick together (surface tension force). This force on the inner surface of the alveoli causes the alveoli to tend to collapse and close. The surfactant is placed between the water molecules and greatly **reduces** this adhesive force. As a result:
1.  It prevents the collapse of the alveoli at the end of exhalation.
2.  It makes it much easier to reopen the alveoli in the next inhalation.
In premature infants, because their lungs are not fully developed, the production of this substance is low. As a result, the surface tension is high, and with each exhalation, the alveoli tend to close, and the infant has to expend a great deal of energy to breathe each time (reopening the alveoli).

*   **Reference from the textbook (page 37, exchange section text):** The book notes: "A substance called surfactant... by **reducing the surface tension force, makes it easier to open the alveoli.** In some infants who are born prematurely... they **breathe with difficulty.**" This "difficulty" is precisely because of the tendency of the alveoli to close.

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A:** Exactly the opposite! Gas exchange is severely disrupted and difficult because the useful respiratory surface (open alveoli) is reduced.
*   **Option C:** This is a possible compensatory mechanism against lack of oxygen, but it is not a **direct result** of surfactant deficiency. The main problem is a physical problem at the alveolar level.
*   **Option D:** The primary problem is ventilation, not perfusion. However, perfusion may also change later to match poor ventilation.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Physical Trap:** This question is based on a physical concept (surface tension). A student who has only memorized the word "surfactant" but has not understood its physical function cannot reason correctly.
*   **Cause and Effect Trap:** Other options may be secondary or unrelated consequences. The question wants the "direct result".

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
This question reminds you that biology is not just about memorization. Many of our body's processes work based on simple laws of physics and chemistry. Always try to understand the "why" of every phenomenon. Why is surfactant important? Because the surface tension of water is high. Why is the surface tension of water high? Because it has a strong hydrogen bond. This deep look sets you apart from the rest. Well done for your effort! Keep up the good work.
