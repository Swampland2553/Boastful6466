### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 10**

**Correct Answer: Option (C)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
This combined question tests your knowledge of two important plasma proteins and their functions.
1.  **Albumin and Osmotic Pressure:** Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and plays a major role in creating the **osmotic pressure of the blood**. This osmotic pressure acts like a sponge and keeps water inside the vessels and at the end of the capillaries, causes the return of water from the interstitial space into the blood. If albumin is low, the osmotic pressure of the blood decreases, as a result, less water returns to the capillaries and collects in the interstitial space. This fluid accumulation causes swelling or **edema**.
2.  **Fibrinogen and Blood Coagulation:** Fibrinogen is one of the key factors in the blood coagulation cascade. When a vessel is damaged, this soluble protein is converted into insoluble **fibrin** threads under the influence of the enzyme thrombin. These threads, like a net, cover the wound and form a blood clot. If fibrinogen is low, this net is not formed and the process of **blood coagulation is impaired** and the person suffers from prolonged bleeding.

*   **Reference from the textbook (pages 61 and 64):** On page 61, the role of plasma proteins in "maintaining osmotic pressure" and "blood coagulation" is mentioned. On page 64, in the coagulation diagram, the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is clearly shown.

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A:** Oxygen transport is the job of hemoglobin in red blood cells, not plasma proteins. A decrease in albumin reduces blood pressure, not increases it.
*   **Option B:** Immune defense is mostly the responsibility of globulins (antibodies) and white blood cells. Impaired kidney function can be the **cause** of decreased albumin, not its direct **consequence**.
*   **Option D:** A decrease in fibrinogen causes a **decrease** in the speed of coagulation, not an increase.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Proteins Trap:** The designer mixes up the functions of different plasma proteins (albumin, globulin, fibrinogen) to trap the student who does not know the exact function of each.
*   **Cause and Effect Trap:** As mentioned, kidney disease can cause albumin excretion and its decrease in the blood. But the question is about the "effects" of protein reduction, not its "causes".

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
For plasma proteins, also draw a three-column table: **Protein Name (albumin, globulin, fibrinogen), Main Function, Result of Deficiency.** This table will help you to review all the key information at a glance. This question shows that the exam is not only looking for big concepts, but also for important and functional details.
