Okay, we have the previously generated list of "Problem-Solving Learnings & Heuristics" for "[Specify the Domain/Topic here]".

Reflecting on our interactions and the specific challenges/solutions encountered *during this current session*:

I want you to **update, refine, and expand** that existing list.
Your goal is to:
1.  **Integrate** any new, distinct learnings from this session.
2.  **Refine or elaborate on** existing points if our recent experience provided more nuance, better strategies, or common pitfalls related to them.
3.  **Merge or consolidate** points if new insights show they are related or can be expressed more efficiently together.
4.  **Ensure all points (both old and new) remain actionable, generalizable (within the domain), concise, and focused on process & strategy**, as per our original criteria.
5.  The resulting list should be a consolidated and improved set of heuristics that builds upon all our experiences so far in "[Repeat the Domain/Topic]".

Please provide the revised and enhanced list of "Problem-Solving Learnings & Heuristics" now.
