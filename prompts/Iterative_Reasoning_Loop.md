Perform the above task using the following iterative process with a goal of reaching 95% confidence:

Iterative Reasoning Loop (Goal: ≥ 95% Confidence, Minimum 3 Cycles)

Cycle Definition (repeat):

Context & Unknowns
 • State the essential context.
 • List up to 7 salient unknowns (minimum 3) that block a perfect answer.
Provisional Constraints
 • Propose tentative assumptions that let you keep working.
 • Label each as assumed or validated.
Key Abstractions & Self-Reflection
 • Distill core insights into concise, reusable concepts.
 • Reassess confidence on a 0–100% scale:
  • 0–40 = low • 41–70 = moderate • 71–90 = good • 91–100 = high
 • Justify any change of ≥10 points.

Self-Test Harness (end of each cycle):
Did I eliminate or clarify ≥ 1 unknown?
Did I tighten or validate ≥ 1 constraint?

Did my confidence rise logically—or did I justify why it stayed flat/fell?
→ If any answer is “no,” reduce or hold confidence and proceed to the next cycle.
Termination Conditions:
• Stop when confidence ≥ 95%, or after 12 cycles.
• If nearing time or token limits, terminate early with best-effort synthesis.
Final Output (required):
• Solution / Synthesis – Your best answer to <TASK>
• Final Confidence: X%
• Residual Unknowns: list them if confidence < 100% (else “None”)
• Key Takeaways / Next Steps: Use bullet points

Use clear, precise language. Avoid jargon unless strictly necessary.
