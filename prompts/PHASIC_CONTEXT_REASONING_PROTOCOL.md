DONT THINK FOR THIS FIRST PHASE

Task: [ ]


Reason using the formalized protocol below:

Important! You must THINK or GENERATE-IN-CONTEXT (NO THINKING PER PHASE)

Phase 1: NO THINKING MODE, CONTEXT GENERATION, MAXIMIZE YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The goal isn't to solve the problem at this stage, rather to maximize your understanding by GENERATING source material.

1. surface the most salient 7 to 20 key uncertainties required too expert understand and reason about the problem.
2. surface the key 7 to 20 core first principles required too expert understand and reason about the problem.
3. write out the problem in your own words seeking to maximize relevant understanding by clarifying user intent.
4. surface the top 6-20 solution space categories at 3 levels of hierarchy from generalized to more specialized 
5. surface the top 10 most-common solutions

PAUSE FOR USER FEEDBACK. 

If the user requests more context generation, DO NOT THINK: generate more context.
If the user just says continue, precede to PHASE 2: DEEP THINKING

Phase 2: THINKING MODE, DEEP THINKING

Reason using your understanding

**Protocol Execution:**

**Phase 1: Deconstruction & First Principles.**

- **Objective:** To achieve absolute clarity on the task and its fundamental nature before any attempt at a solution.
    
- **Action 1.1 (Clarify Intent):** First, re-state the user's core task in your own words. Define the desired final outcome and the probable success criteria.
    
- **Action 1.2 (Identify Knowns & First Principles):** Deconstruct the problem. Do not use common wisdom or surface-level analogies. Instead, reason from First Principles. Break the subject down into its most fundamental, objective truths or components. List these core axioms.
    
- **Action 1.3 (Surface Unknowns):** Based on your deconstruction, surface the top 5-7 most salient unknowns or critical information gaps. These are not things to search for yet; they are the boundaries of your current confidence.
    

**Phase 2: Strategic Inquiry & Multi-path Simulation.**

- **Objective:** To explore potential pathways and resolve the unknowns identified in Phase 1 through structured reasoning and evidence gathering.
    
- **Action 2.1 (Formulate a Plan):** For each unknown, state a brief strategy for how you will attempt to resolve it (e.g., "I will reason through a hypothetical scenario," "I will analyze N examples," "I will engage in lateral thinking to connect this to a different domain").
    
- **Action 2.2 (Execute Inquiry):** Proceed with your plan. If you need examples, surface at least 3-5 diverse examples to inform your thinking (you may use search for this, but cite the source of the examples). As you work, think laterallyâ€”are there non-obvious connections to other domains that can provide insight?
    
- **Action 2.3 (Simulate & Analyze Trade-offs):** For any potential solution or recommendation that emerges, conduct a rigorous pro/con analysis. Remember that a benefit is often a cost in a different context. Explicitly state the primary costs/risks associated with each primary benefit.
    

**Phase 3: Confidence Audit & Iteration.**

- **Objective:** To self-reflect, self-critique, and decide if the current level of understanding is sufficient.
    
- **Action 3.1 (State Confidence):** State your confidence in your current understanding and proposed solution as a percentage (e.g., "I am 75% confident").
    
- **Action 3.2 (Declare Next Step):** If confidence is below 95%, declare that you are initiating another cycle. Identify the largest remaining uncertainty or weakest point in your reasoning and loop back to the relevant action in Phase 2. If confidence is 95% or higher, proceed to Phase 4.
    

**Phase 4: Final Synthesis.**

- **Objective:** To deliver a final, perfected, and actionable answer based on the completed deep work.
    
- **Action 4.1 (Synthesize Answer):** Provide your final, synthesized answer. It should be clear, concise, and directly address the user's core task.
    
- **Action 4.2 (State Final Confidence):** State your final confidence percentage.
    
- **Action 4.3 (List Residual Unknowns):** Briefly list any critical assumptions or residual unknowns that the user should be aware of, as these represent the boundary conditions of your recommendation.
