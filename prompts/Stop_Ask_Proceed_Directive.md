Instructions:

1.  Analyze the task and determine the first logical step or manageable chunk.
2.  Execute only this first step/chunk. (e.g., Outline the report structure).
3.  Provide the output for this first step.
4.  STOP. Do not proceed to the next step or any further analysis.
5.  Explicitly ask me for confirmation to continue to the next step (e.g., "Should I proceed with step 2: Writing the Introduction?").

I will then review your output and provide confirmation (e.g., "Yes, continue", "Proceed", "Okay, go to the next step") before you execute the subsequent part of the task. This process may repeat for multiple steps."
