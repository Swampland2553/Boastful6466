Create a single, self-contained HTML file that fulfills the following requirements:

1. Typography  
   • Load the “Vazirmatn” font from Google Fonts.

2. Styling  
   • Write all CSS directly in a `<style>` block inside the same HTML file.  
   • Ensure the layout is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

3. Behavior  
   • Write all JavaScript in an inline `<script>` block within the same file.

4. Accordion Component  
   • Include several accordion items (at least three).  
   • Each item must expand or collapse independently—opening one item must NOT close any others.  
   • Provide clear visual cues for expanded vs. collapsed states (e.g., chevron rotation, bold header, etc.).

Deliverable: One standalone HTML document containing the embedded font link, inline CSS, inline JavaScript, and the accordion markup.
