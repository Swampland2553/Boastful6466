### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 8**

**Correct Answer: Option (C)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
This is a comparative and combined question about the structure and function of the ventricles.
*   **Simultaneous Contraction:** Both ventricles (left and right) are stimulated by a common conductive system (coming from the AV node) and contract completely **simultaneously** to maximize pumping efficiency.
*   **Pressure Difference:** But the work that these two ventricles do is different. The right ventricle sends blood only to a short and low-resistance path (i.e., to the lungs). But the left ventricle must pump blood to the most distant parts of the body (from the tip of the toe to the brain), which is a very long and high-resistance path. To overcome this resistance, the left ventricle must create much more pressure. That is why the muscular wall of the left ventricle is much thicker than the right ventricle.

*   **Reference from the textbook (page 48, questions at the bottom of the page):** The textbook asks exactly this question: "Why is the thickness of the wall of the left and right ventricles different?" The answer to which goes back to the difference in the path of pulmonary and systemic circulation.

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A:** It is completely the opposite. The **left** ventricle has a thicker wall because it pumps blood to the whole body.
*   **Option B:** The left ventricle receives **oxygenated** blood from the left atrium and sends it to the whole body. It is the duty of the **right** ventricle to send deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
*   **Option D:** The outlet valve from the right ventricle is the **pulmonary semilunar** and the outlet valve from the left ventricle is the **aortic semilunar**. Both are of the semilunar type. The bicuspid and tricuspid valves are the **inlet** valves to the ventricles.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Left and Right Trap:** Confusing the function and structure of the left and right sides of the heart is the most common mistake.
*   **Valves Trap:** Confusing the atrioventricular valves (bicuspid and tricuspid) with the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary).

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
A simple way to never confuse the left and right of the heart: "The left is powerful!". The left side of the heart deals with bright, oxygen-rich blood and must deliver it to the whole body, so its wall is thicker and stronger. Remember this key sentence.
