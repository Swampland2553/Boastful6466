Create a single self-contained HTML document (one file only) that includes:

1. Inline CSS for styling.
2. Inline JavaScript for behavior.
3. An accordion component with multiple items.

Accordion requirements  
• Each item can be expanded or collapsed independently.  
• Opening one item must NOT close any other items (no automatic collapsing).
