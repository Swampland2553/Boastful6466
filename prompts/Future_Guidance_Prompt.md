Okay, we've just worked through a series of problems related to [**Specify the Domain/Topic here, e.g., "optimizing database queries" or "debugging Python code for data analysis"**].

Reflecting on our entire interaction during this session:

I want you to generate a concise list of "Problem-Solving Learnings & Heuristics" specific to [**Repeat the Domain/Topic**].
Think of these as internal "system prompt" notes or "rules of thumb" that you (or another LLM) could use in the future to:
1.  More effectively tackle similar problems within this domain.
2.  Avoid repeating any mistakes or inefficiencies we encountered during this session.
3.  Leverage successful approaches or key insights that emerged.

These notes should be:
*   **Actionable:** Phrased as direct advice or strategies (e.g., "When faced with [specific situation in the domain], first check for [X] because [reason/observed pattern]." or "A common pitfall in [domain] is [Y], so always ensure [Z].").
*   **Generalizable (within the domain):** Not just specific to one problem instance, but applicable to a class of similar problems in [**Repeat the Domain/Topic**].
*   **Concise:** Each point should be clear and to the point.
*   **Focused on Process & Strategy:** Emphasize *how* to approach problems, what to look out for, or what mental models proved useful, rather than just restating facts or solutions.

The goal is for me to collect these "learnings" and provide them to an LLM (potentially you in a future session) at the beginning of a new problem-solving session in [**Repeat the Domain/Topic**] to enhance its performance and build upon the knowledge gained today.

Please list these "Problem-Solving Learnings & Heuristics" now.
