### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 9**

**Correct Answer: Option (A)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
The act of swallowing is a complex and perfectly coordinated process to guide food to the esophagus and prevent it from entering the respiratory tract. Three key events occur simultaneously:
1.  **Uvula Elevation:** The uvula, which hangs from the end of the soft palate, rises and closes the way to the nose from behind so that food does not enter the nasal cavity.
2.  **Epiglottis Depression:** Simultaneously with the larynx rising, this cartilaginous flap, like a lid, covers the entrance of the larynx and closes the way to the trachea.
3.  **Temporary Cessation of Breathing:** The swallowing center in the medulla oblongata temporarily inhibits the respiratory center (which is also in the medulla oblongata) so that inhalation does not occur during swallowing and food is not drawn into the lungs.

*   **Reference from the textbook (page 26, figure 7 and text):** The figure clearly shows the uvula rising and the epiglottis falling. The text also says: "When food reaches the pharynx, swallowing continues involuntarily." and in the respiration chapter (page 33) it also refers to the cessation of breathing during swallowing.

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option B:** Lowering the uvula leaves the way to the nose open. Continuing to breathe is also dangerous.
*   **Option C:** Raising the epiglottis means opening the airway, which is the exact opposite of what should happen.
*   **Option D:** The larynx must rise to help close the epiglottis, not lower.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Functional Trap:** Confusing the direction of movement of the uvula and epiglottis. Remember: the uvula goes **up** (closes the way up) and the epiglottis goes **down** (closes the way down).
*   **Combined Trap:** This question is a combination of the digestive and respiratory chapters and requires mastery of both chapters.

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
Look carefully at the act of swallowing your saliva in front of a mirror once. You will see that your larynx (Adam's apple) clearly moves up and down. This practical observation will help you to never forget the movement of the larynx and to know that this movement is to help close the way to the trachea.
