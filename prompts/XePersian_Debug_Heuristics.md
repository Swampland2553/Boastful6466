Okay, the domain/topic is: "Debugging LaTeX documents using XePersian for Persian typesetting."

Here are the "Problem-Solving Learnings & Heuristics" specific to this domain, based on our interaction:

1.  Font Availability is Paramount:
    *   Heuristic: When a fontspec error like The font "X" cannot be found occurs with XePersian:
        *   First, verify the font name specified in \settextfont{X} is correct and that the font is actually accessible to the XeTeX engine.
        *   As a quick diagnostic or fallback, suggest switching to a widely available and commonly used Persian font (e.g., Amiri) via \settextfont{Amiri}.
        *   If a specific custom font X is required, ensure the user understands that the font file (e.g., X.ttf or X.otf) must either be installed system-wide or, more reliably for Overleaf/portability, uploaded to the project directory and referenced by its exact filename (e.g., \settextfont{X.ttf}).

2.  XePersian/Bidi Loading Order is Critical (Load Late):
    *   Heuristic: When encountering Package bidi Error: Oops! you have loaded package [P] after bidi package... (where [P] is any other package like amsmath, geometry, etc.):
        *   The primary strategy is to move \usepackage{xepersian} and its associated font setup commands (\settextfont{...}, \SepMark{...}, etc.) to be as late as possible in the document preamble, *after* most other \usepackage calls (e.g., amsmath, geometry, enumitem).
        *   This is because xepersian (which loads bidi) needs to modify the behavior of many other packages to work correctly with right-to-left text, and it can do this most effectively if those packages are already loaded.

3.  Compiler Prerequisite:
    *   Heuristic: Before diving into xepersian-specific errors, always confirm or remind the user that documents using xepersian *must* be compiled with XeLaTeX (or LuaLaTeX with appropriate setup, though XeLaTeX is more common for xepersian). A standard pdfLaTeX compiler will not work.

4.  Isolate Errors by Log Analysis:
    *   Heuristic: When presented with a LaTeX log, focus on the *first* significant error message related to fontspec, bidi, xepersian, or an "Undefined control sequence". Subsequent errors are often cascades from the initial problem. Address errors sequentially.

5.  Number Formatting Strategy for XePersian (Decimals, Order, Separator):
    *   Heuristic: For Persian numbers with custom decimal separators (e.g., rendering 2.5 as ۲/۵):
        *   Preamble Setup: Ensure \usepackage{xepersian} is loaded, a Persian font is set with \settextfont{FontName}, and the decimal separator is defined using \SepMark{/} (or desired char) *after* \settextfont.
        *   Input Method: Input decimal numbers in the .tex source using *Latin digits* and a standard dot (e.g., 2.5).
        *   Directionality & Rendering:
            *   If automatic rendering (just typing 2.5 in text) results in incorrect digit order (e.g., ۵.۲ or ۵/۲) or the wrong separator/digit shape:
                *   First, try wrapping the Latin number in \lr{} (e.g., \lr{2.5}). This often fixes the order. Observe if digits become Persian and the separator changes as desired.
                *   If \lr{2.5} yields Latin digits (e.g., 2.5 output) or correct Persian digits but still the wrong separator (e.g., ۲.۵ output when / is expected): The most robust, albeit manual, workaround is to type the *exact desired Persian output* within \lr{}. Example: \lr{۲/۵} to get ۲/۵.
        *   Standard Commands Note:
            *   Commands like `\PersianNumber` can offer specific control over number rendering.
            *   The command `\DefaultDigits` was historically used to ensure Persian digits by default. However, with modern `xepersian` setups, Persian digits are typically rendered by default when a Persian font is active and `xepersian` is loaded. **If `\DefaultDigits` causes an "Undefined control sequence" error, it's often safe (and correct) to remove it.** First, verify if numbers render correctly as Persian digits *without* this command.
            *   If any of these (or other expected `xepersian` number formatting commands) are reported as "Undefined control sequence" (see Heuristic #6), and removing them (if they control default behavior) doesn't yield the correct output, then simpler methods (\lr{} or manual input for complex cases) become necessary, or the command might be obsolete or require a specific package option.

6.  Troubleshooting Undefined XePersian Commands:
    *   Heuristic: If standard xepersian commands (e.g., \PersianNumber, \DefaultDigits) are reported as "Undefined control sequence" even though \usepackage{xepersian} is present and the log shows xepersian loading:
        *   **First, consider if the command is strictly necessary for the desired output, especially if it aims to set a default behavior.** For instance, `\DefaultDigits` might be redundant as modern `xepersian` often defaults to Persian digits when a Persian font is active. Try removing the command and check if the output is already correct before further troubleshooting.
        *   Verify no outdated xepersian.sty or related files are in the local project directory (especially on Overleaf), as these can override system versions.
        *   Suggest clearing the TeX system's cache (e.g., texhash or Overleaf's "Clear Cache" option if available).
        *   Consider testing in a minimal new project to isolate the issue to the environment vs. the specific document. This points to a problem beyond typical document errors.
        *   Be aware that some commands users might expect (e.g., specific counters for list labeling like `\farsialph`) may not actually be part of the standard XePersian distribution or might have been superseded. Always verify command existence in official documentation or through minimal testing if "Undefined control sequence" errors persist with seemingly correct setup.

7.  List Environment Customization (`enumerate` labels):
    *   Heuristic: When \begin{enumerate}[<label_option>] (e.g., [الف)]) causes an error like missing \item or similar list malfunction:
        *   Recognize that this custom label syntax often requires the enumitem package.
        *   A quick fix is to remove the option (e.g., use plain \begin{enumerate}). xepersian will then apply its default Persian list numbering (e.g., "الف.", "ب.").
        *   If specific custom labels (like "الف)") are essential:
            *   Ensure \usepackage{enumitem} is loaded *before* \usepackage{xepersian}.
            *   For Persian alphabetic labels (e.g., "الف)", "ب)"), avoid direct use of Persian characters like `label=\الف*)` as this will cause an "Undefined control sequence" error.
            *   XePersian (as of recent versions) does *not* provide predefined counters like `\farsialph` or `\PersianAlpha` for direct use within `enumitem`'s `label` option.
            *   **Solution 1 (Default XePersian numbering):** Remove the `label` option entirely from the nested `enumerate` environment. XePersian will then automatically apply its default Persian list numbering for sub-items (typically "الف.", "ب.", etc.). This is the quickest way to resolve "Undefined control sequence" errors related to custom Persian labels.
            *   **Solution 2 (Custom Macro for Specific Formatting):** If a very specific format like "(الف)" is absolutely required, the user will need to define a custom LaTeX macro that converts a counter (e.g., `\arabic*`) to the desired Persian character and then use this macro within `enumitem`'s `label` option (e.g., `label=(\mycustompersianalph{\arabic*})`). This is a more advanced solution.

8.  Title Area Formatting (`\maketitle` and blank pages):
    *   Heuristic: If a blank page appears before the title or there are unexpected spacing issues around \maketitle:
        *   Avoid wrapping \maketitle in a center environment. Place centering commands for title elements *inside* the title definition if needed, or apply \centering to specific lines after \maketitle.
        *   Be cautious with manual \vspace commands immediately before or after \maketitle as they can interact unexpectedly with page breaking. Standard class options or packages like titling are generally safer for title customization.

9.  Managing Oversized Content (e.g., TikZ diagrams, wide tables):
    *   Heuristic: When graphical elements (like TikZ pictures) or tables are wider than the text area (`\textwidth`) and get clipped or run off the page:
        *   Symptom: Part of the diagram/table is not visible, extends into the margin, or causes "Overfull \hbox" warnings.
        *   Solution: Use the `adjustbox` package.
            *   Add `\usepackage{adjustbox}` to your preamble.
            *   Wrap the oversized environment (e.g., `tikzpicture`, `tabular`) with `\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth} ... \end{adjustbox}`.
            *   This will scale down the content *only if* it's wider than `\textwidth`, preserving its original size otherwise.
        *   Context: This is a general LaTeX layout technique, extremely useful in XePersian documents when incorporating complex visual elements that might not inherently respect text width boundaries.
