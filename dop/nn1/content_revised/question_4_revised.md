### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 4**

**Correct Answer: Option (C)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
This question examines the relationship between the three systems of blood circulation, respiration, and endocrine (an excellent combined question!).
When the body faces a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia) (for example, at high altitudes), specialized cells in the **kidneys** and to a lesser extent in the **liver**, detect this shortage. In response, they secrete a hormone called **erythropoietin**. This hormone travels through the bloodstream to the **red bone marrow** and stimulates it to increase the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes). More red blood cells mean more oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and the shortage is compensated.

*   **Reference from the textbook (page 63, learn more section and main text):** The text clearly states: "The regulation of the number of red blood cells depends on the secretion of a hormone called **erythropoietin**. This hormone is secreted into the blood by a special group of cells of the **kidney and liver** and acts on the **bone marrow**..."

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A (Gastrin):** It is secreted from the stomach and stimulates the secretion of stomach acid. It has nothing to do with hematopoiesis.
*   **Option B (Secretin):** It is secreted from the duodenum (small intestine) and stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate. It has nothing to do with hematopoiesis.
*   **Option D (Adrenaline):** It is secreted from the adrenal glands and prepares the body for the "fight or flight" response (increased heart rate, blood pressure, etc.). It does not directly cause the production of red blood cells.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Scattered Information Trap:** The designer brings different hormones from different chapters in the options to trap the student who has read the topics in isolation and has not understood the relationship between the systems.
*   **Name Similarity Trap:** Sometimes the names of hormones can be confusing for the student.

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
This question shows you that biology is an integrated science. No chapter is separate from another. Always ask yourself when reading a topic: "How does this process relate to other systems?" For example, here, lack of oxygen (respiration) causes the secretion of a hormone (endocrine) from the kidney (urinary excretion) to act on the bone marrow (skeletal system) and change the blood (circulation of substances)! This combined view is the key to success in the exam.
