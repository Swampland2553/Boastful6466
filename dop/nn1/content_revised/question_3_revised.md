### **Analysis and Detailed Answer for Question 3**

**Correct Answer: Option (B)**

#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
Quiet exhalation is a **passive** process. This means it does not require muscle contraction.
1.  During inhalation, the diaphragm muscle and the external intercostal muscles contracted.
2.  Now, for quiet exhalation, these muscles return to a state of **rest**. The diaphragm, which had flattened during contraction, now relaxes and, due to the pressure of the abdominal viscera, returns to its dome shape (upwards).
3.  This upward movement of the diaphragm reduces the volume of the chest cavity, the air pressure inside the lungs becomes higher than the outside air pressure, and as a result, air is automatically expelled.

*   **Reference from the textbook (page 41, exhalation text):** The book says: "By the **relaxation** of the diaphragm muscle and the external intercostal muscles... the volume of the chest cavity... decreases and the air inside them is pushed out."

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A:** Contraction of the diaphragm causes **inhalation**, not exhalation.
*   **Option C:** Contraction of the external intercostal muscles causes **inhalation**. The movement of the ribs down and in is related to **deep (active) exhalation** and with the contraction of the **internal** intercostal muscles.
*   **Option D:** Contraction of the abdominal muscles is related to **deep and active exhalation**, not quiet exhalation.

#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Big Trap (Active vs. Passive):** The biggest trap in this topic is confusing **inhalation (which is always active)** with **exhalation (which is passive in the normal state and active in the deep state)**. The question designer uses the word "quiet" to emphasize that the passive state is intended, but many people do not pay attention to it.
*   **Muscles Trap:** Confusing the role of the **external** intercostal muscles (for inhalation) with the **internal** (for deep exhalation) and **abdominal muscles** (for deep exhalation).

#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
Take an A4 sheet and divide it into four parts: **quiet inhalation, deep inhalation, quiet exhalation, deep exhalation**. Under each one, write which muscles **contract** and which **relax**. This mind map will free you from these traps forever. Remember, normal exhalation is just relaxing!
