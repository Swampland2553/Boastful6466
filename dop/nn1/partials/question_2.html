        <p><strong>Correct Answer: Option (B)</strong></p>
        <p>#### **Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
Ventricular contraction (ventricular systole) is the most important stage for pumping blood to the body. Let's see what happens step by step:
1.  When the ventricles begin to contract, the pressure inside them rapidly exceeds the pressure inside the atria. This pressure difference causes the atrioventricular valves (i.e., the **mitral** on the left and the **tricuspid** on the right) to **close** forcefully. (This is the first heart sound or "lub").
2.  As the contraction continues, the pressure inside the ventricles also exceeds the pressure inside the arteries (aorta and pulmonary). This pressure difference pushes the **semilunar** valves outwards, **opening** them so that blood can be powerfully ejected into the arteries.</p>
        <p>*   **Reference from the textbook (page 53, figure 8 and text):** The cardiac cycle diagram clearly shows this stage. In the "ventricular contraction" section, the atrioventricular valves are closed and the semilunar valves are open.</p>
        <p>#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
*   **Option A:** Describes the exact opposite of the correct state. This situation corresponds to the time of general relaxation or atrial contraction.
*   **Option C:** At no time in the cardiac cycle are all four valves open simultaneously. This would cause blood to be pushed back in all directions and the pumping system would fail.
*   **Option D:** If the semilunar valves remain closed, blood will not exit the ventricle at all and no pumping will occur. The purpose of ventricular contraction is to open these semilunar valves and eject blood.</p>
        <p>#### **Common Test Traps and Pitfalls:**
*   **Main Trap (Synchronization):** Many students think that the opening and closing of the valves happen one after the other. Whereas at the beginning of ventricular contraction, the atrioventricular valves close first and *a little later* with increasing pressure, the semilunar valves open. But in a general view of this phase, the general state is the closing of one group and the opening of the other.
*   **Heart Sounds Trap:** The first heart sound (lub) is caused by the **closing** of the atrioventricular valves, not their opening!</p>
        <p>#### **Advisor's Recommendations:**
Imagine the cardiac cycle as an animation in your mind. Close your eyes and see: blood enters the atria, the valves open and blood flows into the ventricles. The atria make a small contraction to fill the ventricles completely. Then the ventricles contract powerfully, the entrance doors (atrioventricular) are firmly closed and the exit doors (semilunar) are opened and blood is pumped. This mental visualization is the best way to learn this topic.</p>
